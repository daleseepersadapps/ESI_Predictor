Decision Point A: Immediate Life-Saving Intervention

Content Coverage:
+1: Clearly assesses and excludes the need for immediate life-saving interventions, using both guideline-specific language and relevant supporting details.
0: Mentions the concept but is vague or incomplete.
–1: Misinterprets or omits the criteria, possibly by simply listing keywords without proper context.
Analytical Integration:
+1: Explicitly explains why the absence of these interventions justifies excluding ESI Level 1, linking clinical findings to the decision.
0: Provides minimal or generic explanation that doesn’t clearly link to the decision.
–1: Provides an explanation that is logically disconnected from the decision-making process.
Decision Point B: High-Risk Situation, Altered Mental Status, or Severe Pain/Distress

Content Coverage:
+1: Accurately identifies and lists relevant high-risk factors (e.g., patient age, specific clinical findings) as per the guidelines.
0: Lists some relevant factors but leaves out critical details or uses vague descriptors.
–1: Incorrectly identifies or misapplies high-risk criteria, or simply uses buzzwords without clinical relevance.
Analytical Integration:
+1: Provides clear rationale linking these high-risk factors to the appropriate ESI level (e.g., detailing why these factors necessitate higher-priority care).
0: Mentions the factors without effectively explaining their impact on triage assignment.
–1: Contradicts the high-risk assessment with the final decision, or fails to integrate the high-risk assessment into a coherent rationale.
Decision Point C: Resource Needs Assessment

Content Coverage:
+1: Explicitly itemizes or appropriately describes the resources required, matching them accurately to the guideline’s resource counts.
0: Provides a general statement (e.g., “multiple resources”) without clear breakdown or direct correlation to the guidelines.
–1: Miscounts or misinterprets the resource needs, or uses generic language that obscures the reasoning behind the resource allocation.
Analytical Integration:
+1: Clearly explains how the resource assessment justifies the assigned ESI level and connects this to other decision points.
0: Offers minimal discussion of how resource needs impact the overall triage level.
–1: Shows a disconnect between resource assessment and the final decision, or uses resource terminology as filler without analytical depth.
Decision Point D: Vital Signs Reassessment

Content Coverage:
+1: Accurately reports abnormal vital signs and recognizes their significance as outlined in the guidelines.
0: Mentions vital signs but with incomplete detail or lacks specificity regarding which findings are abnormal.
–1: Ignores or misinterprets vital sign abnormalities, or only superficially mentions them without appropriate context.
Analytical Integration:
+1: Explicitly explains how the abnormal vital signs affect the triage decision (e.g., justifying up-triage to a higher level).
0: Provides little to no explanation of the link between vital signs and the final triage decision.
–1: Presents vital sign data that contradicts the final decision without reconciling the discrepancy.
Overall Logical Consistency, Integration, and Analytical Depth

Content Coverage:
+1: The explanation covers all decision points and includes all necessary guideline elements without omission.
0: Most elements are mentioned but one or two are underdeveloped or superficially addressed.
–1: One or more key elements are missing or are only superficially included as a “checklist” without meaningful content.
Analytical Integration:
+1: The final ESI assignment is logically derived from a well-integrated discussion that connects all decision points. The rationale is coherent, with explicit explanations of how each decision point supports the final triage level.
0: There is some evidence of integration, but there are gaps or inconsistencies where the reasoning is not fully tied together.
–1: The explanation is logically inconsistent; for example, if high-risk indicators are well-described but the final decision contradicts these findings without explanation.
