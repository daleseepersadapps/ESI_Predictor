Modified ESI Guidelines Algorithm:
1. Evaluate the patientâ€™s stability based on vital signs and overall presentation.
2. Consider the severity and acuity of the patient's chief complaint.
3. Account for patient age and any comorbidities if mentioned.
4. Assign an ESI level:
   - ESI 1: Immediate life-saving intervention required.
   - ESI 2: High risk situation, patient should be seen promptly.
   - ESI 3: Stable but requires many resources.
   - ESI 4: Stable and requires one resource.
   - ESI 5: Stable and requires no resources.
Use the guidelines above to determine the proper ESI level and provide a concise explanation for the scoring decision.
